The gild tools
==============

The gild tools are several scripts for managing patches with help of ```git```.
It is derived from the patch management system I devised for the 
[adtools](https://github.com/sba1/adtools), where I use it to to maintain patches
against e.g. gcc. It is general enough that it can be used also for other projects.
